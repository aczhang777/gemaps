# gemaps
This is the code for the work I've done for Dr. Anderson.
The variables in this data set are all different measures of the cries of babies like pitch and loudness
(and some more exotic ones like formant) and a dummy variable that tells us whether or not the baby is at risk for autism.
There are also variables corresponding to the ID of the baby.
This data was submitted by users of Dr. Anderson's app Chatterbaby (this app tells you why your baby is crying and has
a >90% accuracy rate).
